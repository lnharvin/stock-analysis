# stock-analysis

## Overview Of Project: 
Determine whether refactoring previous activity code successfully made the VBA script run faster.

### Purpose:
Successfully refactor VBA script code.

## Analysis And Challenges
I did not allocate enough time to complete this challenge. This was an epic failure for me. My code is duplicating it's values after reaching the second inner loop.

### Analysis Of Outcomes Based On Goals
Analysis is incomplete and fails to compute properly.

### Challenges And Difficulties Encountered
I was unsuccessful in debugging my own code and unable to fix the value duplication.

## Results
Epic fail on submitting my project work. However I did learn that this type of work is in high demand in my immediate area and surrounding counties.
