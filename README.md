### Challenges And Difficulties Encountered
VBS is a lot more involved than I gave it credit for. Here it is week 13 of the course I'm just getting back to cleaning up the mess I made of this project many many weeks ago. I found it more difficult to follow the challenge scripts outline so I went back to my original code and worked forward from them to get the final working results.

## Results
I was finally successful in refractoring the code. In doing so I was able to confirm that refactoring the code made the process run faster. With beginning times of 0.90625 respectly, reduced to roughly 0.8 seconds.
